# Readme

A remake of my first path finding project using python and pygame. 

Here is a link to the JavaScript version. 

https://jontran1.github.io/graph-search-pathfinding-visualization/

Why? To reteach myself python. I mostly used python for machine learning and data-science related projects and wanted to get back into python. Its a wonderful language. 

Right now, only A* shortest path is in. But I will be adding more algorithms soon.

Thanks to this video for getting me started.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A



### How To Run:

- Clone this repo.
- Open up terminal 
- CD into python-path-finding 
- Run this command 'python app.py'.



### How To Use It:

- Left clicking the first time will set the start node.
- Left clicking the second time will set the end node.
- Left clicking after the start and end nodes are set will build walks.
- Right click to remove nodes from the grid. 
- Algorithms won't work without start and end node being set.
- Press c to clear grid.

### How To Run Algorithms:

![number_pad](/images/number_pad.png)

- I'm not very good at GUIs so for now. Algorithms are set to the key number pad. Press 0-4 numbers to activate any of the algorithms. It will stay like this until I figure something else out. 
- 0 - A* Shortest Path Algorithm.
- 1 - Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.
- 2 - Bi-Directional Search Path Algorithm.  
- 3 -  Breadth First Search Algorithm. 
- 4 - Depth First Search Algorithm.

### Heuristic

- Right now the algorithms only use Manhattan distance, which is good enough for this project.
