A remake of my first path finding project using python and pygame. 

Here is a link to the JavaScript version.

Why? To reteach myself python. I mostly used python for machine learning and data-science related projects and wanted to get back into python. Its a wonderful language. 

Right now, only A* shortest path is in. But I will be adding more algorithms soon.

Thanks to this video for getting me started.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A
